# Emergency Communication System using LoRa and ESP32

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a *low-cost Emergency Communication System* designed for *remote, hilly, and disaster-prone regions* where GSM/4G networks are unreliable or unavailable.  
The system enables a user to send an *SOS alert with GPS coordinates* using *LoRa (Long Range) wireless communication, which is received by a nearby **base station* and forwarded to responders.

Unlike satellite phones, this solution is *affordable, portable, and power-efficient*, making it suitable for real-world deployment in resource-constrained areas.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Enable emergency communication without GSM/Internet dependency  
- Transmit SOS alerts with GPS location over long distances  
- Design a low-power, low-cost, portable system  
- Demonstrate reliable communication for disaster scenarios

## 🧠 System Architecture
The system consists of two main units:

### 1️⃣ User Device (Portable SOS Unit)
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- LoRa module (SX1278 / 868 MHz)  
- GPS module (u-blox NEO series)  
- SOS push button  
- Battery-powered (Li-ion + TP4056 charger)  

### 2️⃣ Base Station
- ESP32 microcontroller  
- LoRa module (same frequency as user device)  
- GSM module (SIM800L) for SMS alerts  
- External antenna for long-range reception

## 🔄 Working Principle
1. User presses the *SOS button*  
2. ESP32 reads *GPS coordinates*  
3. Emergency packet is transmitted via *LoRa*  
4. Base station receives and validates the packet  
5. SOS alert is sent via *SMS* to responders
